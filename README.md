# Common Statistical Tests are Linear Models:
## A Modern Workthrough

### What Am I?

This is a reworking of the book [Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats)](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/), written by Jonas Lindeløv. It has been further adapted from [Common statistical tests are linear models: a work through](https://steverxd.github.io/Stat_tests/) by Steve Doogue.

I hope to address a number of gaps found and additionally provide an .epub copy of the book, which renders neatly in the .mobi format, for kindles.

Finally, I hope to eventually roll this up into a package that bundles up the inputs and outputs of common statistical tests into a tidy format, specfically for Rmd notebooks. It's unclear to me how similar this will be to `broom`, but I hope to unify broom with `pixiedust` in order to produce easily extendable dataframes and graphics for common statistical tests in order to further the goal of emphasizing understanding and clarity of communications in place of regurgiated base test output.

### TODO

- [ ] update bib
- [ ] incorporate fixes from pixiedust in order to removed `tribble`'d tables
- [ ] update source data
- [ ] deploy bookdown book
- [ ] compile functions into supporting package
- [ ] build vignettes addressing Lindeløv's [Teaching Materials and Course Outline](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/#9_teaching_materials_and_a_course_outline)
- [ ] work to address Lindeløv's [Limitations](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/#10_limitations)
